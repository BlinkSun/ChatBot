# Notes
*Changes for 0.8:*
This command (**{/cb} /chatbot [on|off]**) is to enable/disable the **ChatBot** for everyone, like a panic button.
For players it's somethings like:

* "Hi **Alice**!";
* "Yo **alice**";
* "Where are you **AliCe** ?";
* "Hey JoeBlow, do you know **Alice** ?";
* ...;
* "Good**bye** to you **aLiCe** !".

When players say something with the namebot (default: alice) in the message for the first time, **ChatBot** ll be set to enable (on). To set it to disable (off), players need to say the namebot with the word "bye" in the same message... that make it more artificial player :p
